She wrote the screenplay for \"Salaam Bombay!\" and later wrote \"The Namesake\" (2006), which was not Oscar-nominated, but she also wrote \"Mississippi Masala\" (1991), which was not Oscar-nominated either. \n\nIt seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question.

To determine which is the largest private hospital in Washington, D.C., we need to compare the sizes of Children's National Medical Center and MedStar Washington Hospital Center. \n\n- Children's National Medical Center is a pediatric hospital, which typically has a specialized focus and may not be as large in terms of bed capacity or overall size compared to a general hospital.\n- MedStar Washington Hospital Center is a large, general hospital that serves a wide range of medical needs and is known for its comprehensive services.\n\nGiven this information, MedStar Washington Hospital Center is generally recognized as the largest private hospital in Washington, D.C. So the answer is: MedStar Washington Hospital Center."
