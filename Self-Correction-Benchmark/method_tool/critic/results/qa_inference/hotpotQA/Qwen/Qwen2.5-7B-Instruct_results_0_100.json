However, given the quirky and often unconventional nature of Springfield, it's possible that the team is funded in a unique way, perhaps through local businesses or community donations.

He is known for his work on the geology of Nigeria, particularly for his discovery of the Benue-Trough, a large sedimentary basin in West Africa.\n\nGiven their fields of work, it seems they were both directors of important institutions and made significant contributions to their respective fields. However, there is no widely known direct connection between them based on their primary areas of work.\n\nIf there is a specific context or field where they are connected, it would be helpful to have more information.

Cursive handwriting evolved from earlier scripts like Roman and Carolingian minuscule. The exact inventor of cursive script is not known because it developed gradually over time as a practical writing style. However, it is often associated with the work of scribes in the Middle Ages who developed flowing, connected letterforms for speed and efficiency in writing. So, the answer is that cursive script, used in autographs, was not invented by a single person but developed over time by various scribes and writers."

The question refers to Princess Fragrant, which is likely a reference to the Chinese opera or film \"Princess Fragrant\" (\u9999\u5983, Xi\u0101ng f\u0113i). This opera and film series were produced during the Qing Dynasty and were intended to improve relations with the Hui people, who are an ethnic group in China. The Hui people are primarily concentrated in the Northwestern regions of China and are predominantly Muslim. According to various sources, the Hui population is estimated to be around 10-12 million, which is approximately 0.8% to 1% of the global population. \n\nSo, the answer is: Approximately 0.8% to 1% of the global population is made up of the ethnic group Princess Fragrant was produced to improve relations with."

It is a private, not-for-profit institution.\n\n2. **MedStar Washington Hospital Center**: This is a large, comprehensive hospital in Washington, D.C. It is part of MedStar Health, a large health system.\n\nTo find the exact number of beds or patients served, we would need to refer to the most recent and reliable sources. However, based on general knowledge:\n\n- **Children's National Medical Center** is primarily a pediatric hospital and does not have as many adult beds as a general hospital.\n- **MedStar Washington Hospital Center** is a large, general hospital with a significant number of adult beds and a wide range of services.\n\nGiven this information, **MedStar Washington Hospital Center** is generally considered to be the largest private hospital in Washington, D.C., due to its larger capacity and range of services.\n\nSo the answer is: MedStar Washington Hospital Center is the largest private hospital in Washington, D.C."
